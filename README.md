# Personal-Modding-Projects
This repository is a public version of my current modding projects. It contains two unfinished projects and three finished projects, all related to Hearts of Iron 4, a ww2 strategy game.

The first unfinished project is my work on creating a custom autonomy state for a nation. 
My second unfinished project is my work on adding events and operational plans to nations. For example, I'm adding a plans for Britain to seize oil fields from certain countries, in prepration for war.
My third and fourth finished projects are attempts to rebalance and make more historical the starting navies of nations in 1936. The r56 version is compatible with another popular mod, R56, for Hearts of Iron 4.
My fifth finshed project is a GUI tool that allows you to debug resource rights. Resource rights are a ingame meachnic where resources in a game area can be controlled. The game normally lacks a way to easily add or remove such resource rights, so I added this GUI to allow players to do so.
